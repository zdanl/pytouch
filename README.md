PyTouch
=======

Welcome to PyTouch 0.1.

Description
===========
This is an utterly small but growing tool. It accelerates the process of
starting a project, or dealing with Python3 projectswithout an IDE in general.
It creates a minimal Python3 project for you. You may also compress and encrypt
entire projects down the road, including generate and obfuscate naming
conventions of functions, variables modules. The type of sample project it
creates depends on a static boilerplate template. There are internal ones
that we support and maintain, but you may also chose an external one.

Dependencies
