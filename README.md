README
======

Welcome to pytouch.

Description
===========
This is utterly nothing. It accelerates the process of starting a project over
and over again. It can read from a template file in case it exists in relative
position to your path, or uses a default fallback. It creates a minimal python
file for you.

Installation
============
Move pytouch binary to $PATH.
